# AMI Agent - SWE-bench Live Lite Submissions

**Agent:** AMI (Agentic Multi-step Inference)  
**Dataset:** SWE-bench Live Lite (300 instances)  
**Repository:** https://github.com/superinference

This directory contains SWE-bench Live Lite evaluation results for the AMI agent across different language models.

## Agent Architecture: AMI

AMI is a fully autonomous coding agent designed for complex software engineering tasks. It operates in detached mode (`--yolo`) without human intervention.

### Core Capabilities

**Tool Set:**
- `file_read` - Read files with line number tracking
- `file_edit` - Precise in-place text replacement editing
- `file_write` - Create new files
- `bash` - Execute shell commands with timeout and error handling
- `web_search` - Search for documentation (optional)

**Autonomous Features:**
- **Contextual Memory Management:** Automatic compaction and summarization
- **Self-Correction:** Retry failed operations with error classification
- **Belief Tracking:** Maintains internal state of understanding
- **Multi-Turn Planning:** Explores, plans, and executes complex fixes
- **Error Recovery:** Sophisticated error taxonomy with recovery strategies

### Agent Execution Model

1. **Understanding Phase:** Reads the GitHub issue/problem statement
2. **Exploration Phase:** Explores codebase structure, reads relevant files
3. **Hypothesis Formation:** Identifies potential root causes
4. **Implementation:** Applies fixes via file edits
5. **Verification:** Runs tests to validate the fix
6. **Iteration:** Self-corrects based on test failures

The agent automatically manages context window limits through intelligent compaction.

## Quick Start

All verification scripts are in `scripts/` and work directly with the bundled data:

```bash
cd scripts/
export MODEL_SLUG=20260623-claude-opus-4-6

# Run all validation checks
bash test-all-scripts.sh

# Analyze results
bash evaluate-results.sh --summary
bash evaluate-results.sh --detailed
bash evaluate-results.sh --failures

# Verify a specific instance
bash verify-instance.sh amoffat__sh-744

# Test that a patch applies cleanly
bash test-patch-apply.sh amoffat__sh-744
```

## Experimental Settings

### Common Configuration (All Models)

```bash
Max Turns: 140 per instance
Timeout: None (instances run to completion or max turns)
Samples: 1 (single attempt per instance)
Mode: Detached/YOLO (no human intervention)
Output Format: JSON with structured results
```

### Environment

- **Python Versions:** 3.9+ (per repository requirements)
- **Execution:** Isolated temporary directories per instance
- **Dependencies:** Automatically installed from repository
- **Git:** Cloned from bare mirrors for speed
- **Base Commit:** Each instance fixed from its specified base_commit

### Resource Limits (Custom Harness)

- **CPU:** No limit (native execution)
- **Memory:** No explicit limit (system default)
- **Disk:** Temporary /tmp directories, cleaned per instance
- **Network:** Enabled for package installation

## Evaluation Methodology

### Custom Harness (Used for Our Results)

**Process:**
1. Clones repository at base_commit
2. Runs AMI agent with problem statement
3. Agent explores, debugs, and fixes the issue
4. Captures git diff as patch
5. Applies test_patch and runs tests
6. Evaluates `FAIL_TO_PASS` and `PASS_TO_PASS`

**Output:** Rich metrics including tokens, turns, behavior, trajectories

### Official Docker Evaluation (For Leaderboard)

**Location:** `https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live/` (python-only branch)

**Command:**
```bash
python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation \
    --dataset_name SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live \
    --split lite \
    --predictions_path preds.json \
    --max_workers 4 \
    --run_id ami-evaluation
```

**Process:**
1. Loads patches from preds.json
2. Spins up Docker container per instance
3. Applies patch in isolated environment
4. Runs tests
5. Reports resolution status

**Output:** Minimal metrics (resolved: true/false only)

### Resolution Criteria (SAME FOR BOTH)

An instance is **resolved** if and only if:

1. **ALL FAIL_TO_PASS tests pass**
   - Tests that failed on base_commit
   - Must pass after applying the patch
   - Verifies the bug is actually fixed

2. **ALL PASS_TO_PASS tests pass**
   - Tests that passed on base_commit
   - Must still pass after the patch
   - Verifies no regressions introduced

**Both conditions must be true.** Partial fixes count as unresolved.

## Submission Files

### Required Files (Per Model)

Each model directory contains:

1. **preds.json** - Patches for all instances
   ```json
   {
     "instance_id": {
       "model_name_or_path": "ami-model-name",
       "instance_id": "instance_id",
       "model_patch": "diff --git a/file.py ..."
     }
   }
   ```

2. **results.json** - Evaluation summary
   ```json
   {
     "total_instances": 300,
     "completed_instances": 299,
     "resolved_instances": 189,
     "resolved_ids": [...],
     "unresolved_ids": [...],
     "schema_version": 2
   }
   ```

3. **results/** - Per-instance evaluation details (299 files)
   ```json
   {
     "instanceId": "amoffat__sh-744",
     "repo": "amoffat/sh",
     "resolved": true,
     "exitReason": "max_turns",
     "turns": 140,
     "failToPass": {"passed": 1, "total": 1},
     "passToPass": {"passed": 178, "total": 178},
     "tokens": {"prompt": 4811682, "completion": 18314, "total": 4829996},
     "behavior": {"fileReads": 11, "fileEdits": 5, "bashCalls": 93, ...}
   }
   ```
   Each file contains the full evaluation metrics for one instance: test pass/fail
   counts, token usage, agent behavior stats, exit reason, and resolution status.
   These files are the raw evidence backing the aggregate numbers in `results.json`.

4. **trajs/** - Agent trajectory files (optional but recommended)
   - Full conversation logs
   - Tool calls and responses
   - Agent reasoning steps

## Verification

This submission can be verified two independent ways, and both should produce
consistent results (~63% resolution rate). The agent is never re-run — only
the existing patches in `preds.json` are evaluated.

### Method A: Custom Harness Results (Bundled)

The bundled per-instance result files (`results/`) contain the full evaluation
output from our custom harness. These scripts analyze them directly — no
external dependencies required:

```bash
cd scripts/
export MODEL_SLUG=20260623-claude-opus-4-6

# Validate submission format and structure
bash validate-official-format.sh
bash test-all-scripts.sh

# Summary statistics (resolution rate, test pass rates, failure breakdown)
bash evaluate-results.sh --summary

# Per-repository breakdown
bash evaluate-results.sh --detailed

# Analyze failure patterns (regressions, partial fixes, timeouts)
bash evaluate-results.sh --failures

# Inspect a specific instance (tests, tokens, patch, behavior)
bash verify-instance.sh amoffat__sh-744

# Test that a patch applies cleanly
bash test-patch-apply.sh amoffat__sh-744
```

### Method B: Official Docker Evaluation

Independently re-evaluate the **same patches** using the official SWE-bench-Live
Docker methodology ([python-only branch](https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live/tree/python-only)).
This takes `preds.json`, runs each patch through an isolated Docker container,
and reports resolution status — the same way the leaderboard is computed.

**Prerequisites:** Docker running + official SWE-bench-Live repo (python-only branch).

```bash
# One-time setup
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live
cd SWE-bench-Live && git checkout python-only && pip install -e .
export SWEBENCH_LIVE_REPO=$(pwd)
```

```bash
cd scripts/
export MODEL_SLUG=20260623-claude-opus-4-6

# Evaluate all patches with official Docker method
bash official-evaluation.sh --evaluate
```

### Comparing Both Methods

The comparison script runs both evaluations on a sample of instances and
reports agreement — proving that the custom harness and official Docker
evaluation produce consistent results:

```bash
cd scripts/
export MODEL_SLUG=20260623-claude-opus-4-6
export SWEBENCH_LIVE_REPO=/path/to/SWE-bench-Live

# Compare on 10 sample instances (balanced resolved/unresolved)
bash compare-evaluation-methods.sh

# Compare on custom sample size
bash compare-evaluation-methods.sh --sample 20

# Compare all instances (WARNING: 20-40 hours)
bash compare-evaluation-methods.sh --full
```

The output shows instance-by-instance agreement between both methods and
projects the expected full-dataset results. Both methods evaluate the same
patches from `preds.json` — the agent is never re-run.

## Trajectory Files

Each trajectory file (`trajs/<instance_id>.json`) contains:
- Full conversation history between AMI and the codebase
- Tool calls (file reads, edits, bash commands)
- Agent reasoning and planning steps
- Error messages and recovery attempts
- Test execution results

This data is valuable for:
- Understanding agent behavior
- Identifying failure patterns
- Improving agent capabilities
- Research and analysis

## Known Limitations

1. **Max Turns Ceiling:** Some complex issues hit the 140-turn limit
2. **Test Infrastructure:** Flaky or environment-dependent tests may fail
3. **Single Attempt:** Each instance attempted once (no retry or ensemble)
4. **Context Limits:** Very large files may require compaction

## Sampling Strategy

**Single-pass, no sampling:**
- Each instance run exactly once
- No temperature variation
- No majority voting
- No retry on failure

This represents the agent's "first attempt" performance without post-processing.

## Differences Between Custom and Official Evaluation

### Factual Differences

1. **Instance Set:**
   - Custom: All 300 instances
   - Official: Only instances passing gold patches (~280-290)

2. **Environment:**
   - Custom: Native Python, latest dependencies
   - Official: Fixed Docker environment per instance

3. **Metrics:**
   - Custom: Tokens, turns, behavior, trajectories
   - Official: Resolved status only

## Reproduction

To reproduce results from scratch, install the AMI binary and run it against
SWE-bench-Live Lite instances. No external scripts are needed — the steps
below are fully self-contained.

### 1. Install AMI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.superinference.org/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Get the Dataset

```bash
pip install datasets
python3 -c "
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset('SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live', split='lite')
ds.to_json('swebench-live-lite.jsonl')
"
```

### 3. Run a Single Instance

```bash
# Pick an instance from the dataset
INSTANCE_ID="amoffat__sh-744"
INSTANCE=$(jq -c "select(.instance_id == \"$INSTANCE_ID\")" swebench-live-lite.jsonl)

REPO=$(echo "$INSTANCE" | jq -r '.repo')
BASE_COMMIT=$(echo "$INSTANCE" | jq -r '.base_commit')
PROBLEM=$(echo "$INSTANCE" | jq -r '.problem_statement')

# Clone repo at the base commit
git clone "https://github.com/$REPO.git" workdir && cd workdir
git checkout "$BASE_COMMIT"

# Create virtualenv and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Run AMI autonomously (no human intervention)
ami --model claude-opus-4-20250115 \
    --api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    --prompt "You are fixing a bug in $REPO. $PROBLEM" \
    --max-turns 140 \
    --yolo \
    --output-format json \
    --quiet > ami-output.json

# Capture the agent's patch
git diff "$BASE_COMMIT" > agent.patch
```

AMI explores the codebase, identifies the bug, applies a fix, and verifies it
against the failing tests — all autonomously (`--yolo`). The `--output-format json`
flag produces structured output with turns, tokens, tool calls, and exit reason.

### 4. Evaluate the Patch

```bash
# Apply the dataset's test patch
TEST_PATCH=$(echo "$INSTANCE" | jq -r '.test_patch')
echo "$TEST_PATCH" | git apply

# Run the tests
python -m pytest -xvs <test_files_from_test_patch>
```

An instance is **resolved** when all `FAIL_TO_PASS` tests pass and all
`PASS_TO_PASS` tests still pass after applying the agent's patch.

### 5. Run All 300 Instances

```bash
# Loop over all instances with controlled parallelism
for INSTANCE_ID in $(jq -r '.instance_id' swebench-live-lite.jsonl); do
  # Same steps as above for each instance
  # Run with PARALLEL=2 workers for throughput (~24-48 hours total)
done
```

Each instance produces a result JSON with resolution status, test pass/fail
counts, token usage, and agent behavior metrics. Aggregate these into
`preds.json` (patches) and `results.json` (summary) for submission.
